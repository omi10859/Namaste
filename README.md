### 1. Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get a fork/copy of [Namaste](https://github.com/omi10859/Namaste) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd></a> button.

### 2. Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

### 3. Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that your local copy has a reference to your forked remote repository in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Namaste.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Namaste.git (push)
```

Now, lets add a reference to the original [Namaste](https://github.com/omi10859/Namaste) repository using

```sh
>$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/omi10859/Namaste.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***

### 4. Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
